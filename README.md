## Installation

```bash
pip install python-ciso-assistant-client
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv pip install python-ciso-assistant-client
```

## Quick Start

### Synchronous Client

```python
from ciso_assistant_client import CISOAssistantClient, ApiToken

# Basic usage
with CISOAssistantClient(base_url="https://your-ciso-instance.com") as client:
    # List folders
    folders = client.list_folders(limit=100)
    for folder in folders.results:
        print(f"{folder.id}: {folder.name}")
    
    # List assets
    assets = client.list_assets(limit=50, search="server")
    for asset in assets.results:
        print(f"{asset.name}: {asset.business_value}")
    
    # List evidences
    evidences = client.list_evidences(limit=20)
    for evidence in evidences.results:
        print(f"{evidence.name}: {evidence.attachment}")
```

### Authentication

```python
from ciso_assistant_client import CISOAssistantClient, ApiToken

# With API Token
auth = ApiToken(token="your-api-token-here")
with CISOAssistantClient(base_url="https://your-ciso-instance.com", auth=auth) as client:
    folders = client.list_folders()
```

### SSL Certificate Verification

Control SSL certificate verification for secure or development environments:

```python
from ciso_assistant_client import CISOAssistantClient, ApiToken
from ssl import create_default_context

auth = ApiToken(token="your-api-token")

# Default - SSL verification enabled (recommended for production)
with CISOAssistantClient(base_url="https://ciso.example.com", auth=auth) as client:
    folders = client.list_folders()

# Disable SSL verification (for development/testing with self-signed certificates)
with CISOAssistantClient(
    base_url="https://ciso-dev.example.com",
    auth=auth,
    verify=False
) as client:
    folders = client.list_folders()

# Use custom CA bundle file
with CISOAssistantClient(
    base_url="https://ciso.example.com",
    auth=auth,
    verify="/path/to/custom-ca-bundle.crt"
) as client:
    folders = client.list_folders()

# Use custom SSL context for advanced configuration
import ssl
ssl_context = create_default_context()
ssl_context.check_hostname = True
ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED
with CISOAssistantClient(
    base_url="https://ciso.example.com",
    auth=auth,
    verify=ssl_context
) as client:
    folders = client.list_folders()
```

**Security Note:** Disabling SSL verification (`verify=False`) should only be done in development/testing environments. Always use SSL verification in production to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### Creating Resources

```python
from ciso_assistant_client import CISOAssistantClient, ApiToken, FolderWrite, AssetWrite, EvidenceWrite

auth = ApiToken(token="your-api-token")
with CISOAssistantClient(base_url="https://ciso.example.com", auth=auth) as client:
    # Create a folder
    folder = FolderWrite(name="My Folder", description="Test folder")
    created_folder = client.create_folder(folder)
    print(f"Created folder: {created_folder.id}")
    
    # Create an asset
    asset = AssetWrite(
        name="Production Server",
        business_value="Critical",
        type="Primary",
        folder=created_folder.id
    )
    created_asset = client.create_asset(asset)
    
    # Create evidence
    evidence = EvidenceWrite(
        name="Security Audit 2024",
        folder=created_folder.id,
        attachment="https://example.com/audit.pdf"
    )
    created_evidence = client.create_evidence(evidence)
```

### Asynchronous Client

```python
from ciso_assistant_client import AsyncCISOAssistantClient, ApiToken

async def main():
    auth = ApiToken(token="your-api-token")
    async with AsyncCISOAssistantClient(base_url="https://ciso.example.com", auth=auth) as client:
        # List resources
        folders = await client.list_folders(limit=100)
        assets = await client.list_assets(limit=50)
        evidences = await client.list_evidences(limit=20)
        
        # Get specific resources
        folder = await client.get_folder("folder-uuid")
        asset = await client.get_asset("asset-uuid")
        evidence = await client.get_evidence("evidence-uuid")
```

### Pagination

The client provides built-in pagination support for navigating through large result sets:

```python
from ciso_assistant_client import CISOAssistantClient, ApiToken

auth = ApiToken(token="your-api-token")
with CISOAssistantClient(base_url="https://ciso.example.com", auth=auth) as client:
    # Get first page of folders
    page1 = client.list_folders(limit=10)
    print(f"Page 1: {len(page1.results)} folders, Total: {page1.count}")
    
    # Navigate to next page
    if page1.next:
        page2 = client.next_page(page1)
        if page2:
            print(f"Page 2: {len(page2.results)} folders")
    
    # Navigate back to previous page
    if page2 and page2.previous:
        page1_again = client.previous_page(page2)
        if page1_again:
            print(f"Back to page 1: {len(page1_again.results)} folders")
    
    # Iterate through all pages
    current_page = client.list_folders(limit=50)
    while current_page:
        for folder in current_page.results:
            print(f"  - {folder.name}")
        
        # Get next page, or None if no more pages
        current_page = client.next_page(current_page)
```

The pagination methods work with any paginated response type (folders, assets, evidences) and maintain type safety.

## API Coverage

The client currently supports full CRUD operations for:

- **Folders**: `list_folders()`, `get_folder()`, `create_folder()`, `delete_folder()`
- **Assets**: `list_assets()`, `get_asset()`, `create_asset()`, `delete_asset()`
- **Evidences**: `list_evidences()`, `get_evidence()`, `create_evidence()`, `delete_evidence()`

### Pagination Methods

Navigate through paginated results with type-safe methods:

- **`next_page(paged_result)`**: Fetch the next page of results, returns `None` if no next page
- **`previous_page(paged_result)`**: Fetch the previous page of results, returns `None` if no previous page

These methods work with any paginated response (`PagedFolderRead`, `PagedAssetRead`, `PagedEvidenceRead`) and automatically maintain the correct type.

All methods support both synchronous and asynchronous usage.
